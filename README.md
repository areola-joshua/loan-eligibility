:clap:Data Set Problems
👉 The company seeks to automate (in real time) the loan qualifying procedure based on information given by customers while filling out an online application form. It is expected that the development of ML models that can help the company predict loan approval in accelerating decision-making process for determining whether an applicant is eligible for a loan or not.

Objectives of Notebook
👉 This notebook aims to:
Analyze customer data provided in data set (EDA)
Build various ML models that can predict loan approval
👨‍💻 The machine learning models used in this project are:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boost

Data Set Description
👉 There are 13 variables in this data set:

8 categorical variables,
4 continuous variables, and
1 variable to accommodate the loan ID.
